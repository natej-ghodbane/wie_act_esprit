# Stock Management System Setup Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive stock management system for your marketplace application with the following features:

### âœ… Features Implemented

#### Backend Features:
1. **Enhanced Product Schema** - Added stock threshold and alert settings
2. **Notification System** - Database-stored notifications with different priorities
3. **Stock Movement Tracking** - Complete audit trail of inventory changes
4. **Advanced Stock Management APIs** - Bulk updates, threshold management, analytics
5. **Automated Monitoring** - Background jobs for low stock alerts and daily reports

#### Frontend Features:
1. **Notification Center** - Full notification management interface
2. **Notification Bell** - Real-time unread count display
3. **Stock Analytics Dashboard** - Comprehensive inventory insights
4. **Enhanced Product Management** - Individual threshold settings per product
5. **Visual Stock Indicators** - Clear low stock and out-of-stock warnings

## Installation Steps

### 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory and install the new dependency:

```bash
cd backend
npm install @nestjs/schedule@^4.0.0
```

### 2. Database Migration
The new schemas will be automatically created when you start the application. Existing products will use default values:
- `lowStockThreshold`: 5
- `enableLowStockAlerts`: true

### 3. Start the Applications

Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## New API Endpoints

### Stock Management
- `PUT /api/products/:id/stock` - Adjust stock levels
- `POST /api/products/stock/bulk-update` - Bulk stock updates
- `GET /api/products/stock/movements` - Get stock movement history
- `PUT /api/products/:id/threshold` - Update low stock threshold
- `GET /api/products/stock/low` - Get low stock products
- `GET /api/products/stock/analytics` - Get inventory analytics

### Notifications
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/count/unread` - Get unread count
- `PUT /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

## Key Features Explained

### 1. Automated Stock Monitoring
- **Hourly checks** for low stock products
- **Daily inventory reports** (9 AM) for vendors with stock issues
- **Duplicate prevention** - Won't spam with notifications

### 2. Individual Product Thresholds
- Each product can have its own low stock threshold
- Default threshold is 5 but can be customized
- Alerts can be enabled/disabled per product

### 3. Stock Movement History
- Complete audit trail of all inventory changes
- Tracks reasons (manual_adjustment, sale, restock, damage, etc.)
- Includes user who made the change and timestamps

### 4. Real-time Notifications
- Instant alerts when stock goes low or runs out
- Persistent notifications stored in database
- Visual indicators in the UI

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
- Total inventory overview
- Low stock and out-of-stock counts
- Recent stock movements history
- Visual charts and insights

## Usage Guide

### For Vendors:
1. **Managing Stock**: Use the enhanced product management page to update quantities
2. **Setting Thresholds**: Click the settings icon next to each product's threshold
3. **Viewing Analytics**: Toggle the analytics dashboard to see inventory insights
4. **Notifications**: Click the bell icon to view and manage stock alerts

### Stock Operations:
- **Manual Updates**: Direct quantity adjustments with automatic notifications
- **Threshold Management**: Individual low stock thresholds per product
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass updates via API (can be extended to UI)
- **Movement Tracking**: Complete history of all stock changes

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Background Jobs:
- **Low Stock Check**: Runs every hour (`@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_HOUR)`)
- **Daily Reports**: Runs at 9 AM daily (`@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_DAY_AT_9AM)`)

### Logs:
Monitor application logs for stock monitoring activities:
```bash
# Backend logs will show:
# - "Starting low stock check..."
# - "Found X products with low or no stock"
# - "Sent low-stock alert for product: ..."
```

## Customization Options

### Notification Timing:
Edit `stock-monitor.service.ts` to change:
- Check frequency (currently hourly)
- Report timing (currently 9 AM daily)
- Notification cooldown period (currently 24 hours)

### Threshold Defaults:
Edit `product.schema.ts` to change the default threshold from 5 to any other value.

### Stock Reasons:
Add more stock movement reasons in:
- `stock-movement.schema.ts` (enum values)
- `stock-management.dto.ts` (validation)
- Frontend components (display logic)

## Testing the System

1. **Create/Update Products**: Add products with different stock levels
2. **Set Thresholds**: Try different threshold values for different products  
3. **Trigger Alerts**: Reduce stock below threshold to test notifications
4. **Check Analytics**: View the analytics dashboard for insights
5. **Stock History**: Make several stock changes and view the movement history

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Notifications not working**: Check that the NotificationsModule is properly imported
2. **Background jobs not running**: Ensure `@nestjs/schedule` is installed and ScheduleModule is imported
3. **Analytics not loading**: Verify API endpoints are accessible and returning data
4. **Threshold updates failing**: Check authentication and product ownership

### Database Considerations:
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
- The notification and stock movement collections will be created automatically
- Consider adding indexes for better performance on large datasets

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Notifications**: Extend to send email alerts for critical stock levels
2. **SMS Alerts**: Add SMS notifications for urgent stock situations
3. **Reorder Automation**: Automatically create reorder suggestions
4. **Supplier Integration**: Connect with supplier APIs for automatic reordering
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Add charts, trends, and forecasting
6. **Mobile App**: Create mobile notifications for stock alerts

Your stock management system is now fully operational and ready for production use!

   - Increase back to 10+ to trigger restock notification

### Method 2: Through Test Script

### Features:
- Prevents notification spam (24-hour cooldown)
- Only notifies for enabled products (`enableLowStockAlerts: true`)
- Respects individual product thresholds

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Notifications not appearing**:
   - Check that you're logged in as the product owner
   - Ensure `enableLowStockAlerts` is true for the product
   - Verify threshold settings

2. **Inventory updates failing**:
   - Check authentication (valid token)
   - Verify you own the product
   - Ensure positive numbers for quantity

3. **Frontend not connecting to backend**:
   - Confirm backend is running on port 3001
   - Check `.env.local` file has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api`

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check backend logs for API calls
3. Verify database connection
4. Test individual API endpoints with tools like Postman

# Stripe Payment Fix Documentation

## Problem
All payments were showing as "echec" (failed) on the dashboard because Stripe webhooks were not properly processing payment completion events.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Raw Body Parsing Issue**: Stripe webhooks require raw body parsing for signature verification, but NestJS was parsing the body as JSON
2. **Missing Customer Email**: Frontend wasn't passing customer email to Stripe checkout sessions
3. **Webhook Signature Verification**: Webhook signature verification was failing due to body parsing issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend - Raw Body Parsing for Webhooks
**File**: `backend/src/main.ts`
- Added raw body parsing middleware specifically for the webhook endpoint
- Configured `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` for `/api/payments/webhook`

### 2. Backend - Enhanced Webhook Processing
**File**: `backend/src/payments/payments.controller.ts`
- Fixed webhook signature verification to handle raw body (Buffer)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Added test endpoint for manual payment verification

### 3. Backend - Order Session Tracking
**File**: `backend/src/orders/orders.service.ts`
- Added `updateSessionId()` method to store Stripe session ID in orders
- Enhanced order lookup by session ID

### 4. Frontend - Customer Email Integration
**Files**: 
- `frontend/pages/buyer/cart.tsx`
- `frontend/components/marketplace/PaymentModal.tsx`
- `frontend/utils/api.ts`
- Added customer email to checkout session creation
- Updated API interfaces to include `orderId` and `customerEmail`

### 5. Backend - Session ID Storage
**File**: `backend/src/payments/payments.controller.ts`
- Store Stripe session ID in order when creating checkout session
- This provides a reliable way to match webhook events to orders

## How the Fixed Flow Works

1. **Order Creation**: User creates order with items
2. **Checkout Session**: Frontend creates Stripe checkout session with:
   - Order ID in metadata
   - Customer email
   - Session ID stored in order record
3. **Payment Processing**: User completes payment on Stripe
4. **Webhook Processing**: Stripe sends webhook with raw body
5. **Order Update**: Backend processes webhook and updates order status to "paid"

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/payments/test-payment-success
{
  "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
  "customerEmail": "user@example.com"
}
```

### 2. Test Manual Order Update
```bash
POST /api/payments/test-webhook
{
  "orderId": "order_id_here"
}
```

### 3. Mark All Orders as Paid (for testing)
```bash
POST /api/payments/mark-all-paid
```

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your environment:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your Stripe webhook endpoint secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Stripe publishable key

## Webhook Configuration

1. In Stripe Dashboard, create a webhook endpoint pointing to: `https://your-backend-url.com/api/payments/webhook`
2. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
3. Copy the webhook secret and set it as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Verification

After deploying these fixes:
1. Create a test order
2. Complete payment through Stripe
3. Check that the order status changes to "paid" in the dashboard
4. Verify webhook logs show successful processing

## Additional Improvements

- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for order matching
- Better error handling and reporting
- Test endpoints for manual verification
